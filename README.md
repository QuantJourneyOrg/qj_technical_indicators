Welcome to the **Technical Indicators Library**, a high-performance, open-source collection of financial technical indicators. Originally developed as part of the [QuantJourney project](https://quantjourney.substack.com) by Jakub Polec, it‚Äôs now freely available under the MIT License for everyone to use, fork, and improve as a Quantitative Infrastructure initiative, providing traders and investors with fast, reliable tools for financial analysis.

- **No TA-Lib Required**: Built from the ground up with NumPy, Pandas, and yfinance.
- **Execution Timing**: Features a decorator to measure and log computation times.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT for unrestricted use in any project.
